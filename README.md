# Mask_detection based access terminal

#### Developed CNN with MobileNetV2 using Tensorflow 2.4.1 to detect faces with or without mask. 
#### Real time detection is performed with the OpenCV to extract ROI. 
#### Based on real time computation, desired control signal is sent to gate through arduino microcontroller. 
#### Communcation between python and arduino is established using PySerial library.

###### Model Accuracy: 98.4%
